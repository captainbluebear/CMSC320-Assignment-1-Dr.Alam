Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: Git is a version control system which makes it easier to keep track of iterations of a file or project. It allows people to revert to older versions of a project if necessary. It also provides an easy method of allowing multiple people to work on a single project such that their changes can be combined into a single file.
